# Chef Cat Showcase Game (Project 1)
 
## About the Project 1
Cat chef is a 2D platformer like the Mario games from the NES era. You're a üê± Catman trying to make a üç∞ cake by collecting ingredients and the enemies are üçå banana men. This game was created to show what we learned over the past two years of games in Unity. This game was built in a month with 2 developments, a programmer (Daniel Cox), and a designer (Ben Topple). This game is available on our portfolio and playable via itch.io. This is the only alpha version of the game. This is not the whole game, this is only a demo to showcase what we have learned.
